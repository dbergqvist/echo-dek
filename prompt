I want to create a web app that links music between diferent streaming services
The first critical user journey would be to search for an artist
When you have selected the artist you are looking for the web app will list all the albums by that artist
After selecting the album the system will generate the URI for the album on Spotify and Apple Music
This way friends using different streaming services can easily share albums with each other
Let's make it stateless in the first version
Let's get music metadata from MusicBrainz web API
Let's create the frontend using Sveltekit and the backend using flask
Let's also make it deployable to Google Cloud Run
